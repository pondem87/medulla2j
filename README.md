# Welcome to Medulla2J project

This is a rewrite of the Medulla Projects from Typescript and Node.js to Java/Spring Boot and Python/FAST-API

The project is reengineered to address maintainability, reliability and documentation. A disciplined software engineering
process is followed starting from requirements to domain modelling and use case modelling to analysis classes and design classes
to implementation and testing. This should help eliminate the emergence of God classes, difficult to trace dependencies and
side effects, and difficult requirements traceability.

Here is a guide through the documentation
